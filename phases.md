# 🚀 AI Calling Bot – Hybrid Workflow (Step-by-Step Phases)

---

## **Phase 1 – Core Bot Engine (Brain)**

🎯 Goal: Build the intelligence pipeline (STT → GPT → TTS). Test locally with mic & speaker.

### Tasks:

1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
    
    - Install [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper).
        
    - Input: microphone audio → text.
        
    - Output: `"Hello, who’s calling?"`.
        
2. **Bot Logic (LLM Brain)**
    
    - Use OpenAI GPT API (or local LLM if you want free).
        
    - Implement conversation flow (scripts, Q&A, booking intent).
        
3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
    
    - Options:
        
        - Free: gTTS (basic).
            
        - Mid: Coqui TTS (offline, customizable).
            
        - Paid: ElevenLabs (very realistic).
            
    - Output: `"Great! Can I share more details?"` → bot voice.
        

✅ At the end of this phase → you can talk with the bot using your mic & speakers (no calls yet).

## **Phase 2 – Fake Call Environment (No Cost Testing)**

🎯 Goal: Simulate phone calls before spending on real telecom.

### Tasks:

1. **Softphone Setup**
    
    - Install Zoiper or Linphone (acts like a phone app on PC).
        
2. **Asterisk PBX Setup**
    
    - Install Asterisk on your VPS or laptop.
        
    - Configure one extension for **Bot Engine**.
        
    - Configure another extension for **Softphone**.
        
3. **Integration**
    
    - Connect Asterisk ↔ Bot Engine (via SIP).
        
    - Now you can “call” your bot from Zoiper.
        

✅ At the end of this phase → you’re testing **real phone-like conversations** with zero cost.

## **Phase 3 – Real Calls (Small Scale, Cheap)**

🎯 Goal: Enable real inbound/outbound calls using SIP trunks.

### Tasks:

1. **Choose SIP Trunk Provider** (cheap/free trial):
    
    - Telnyx, Callcentric, Flowroute, etc.
        
2. **Connect Provider → Asterisk → Bot**
    
    - Incoming calls → go to bot.
        
    - Outgoing calls → bot dials through Asterisk.
        
3. **Enable Recording + Logging (optional)**
    
    - Asterisk supports saving call audio + logs.
        

✅ At the end of this phase → your bot can **actually call people**.

## **Phase 4 – Production & Scaling**

🎯 Goal: Make it reliable, compliant, and business-ready.

### Tasks:

1. **Switch to Stable Providers**
    
    - Twilio / Exotel for legal scaling + carrier compliance.
        
2. **Add Business Features**
    
    - Payments: Bot sends WhatsApp/UPI link → confirm via webhook.
        
    - Orders/Bookings: Save into database → notify owner.
        
    - Calendar Integration: For reservations.
        
    - Analytics Dashboard: Calls, success rate, conversion.
        
    - Contact List Management: Upload numbers, manage DND/opt-outs.
        
    - Human Handoff: If bot fails, transfer call to human.
        

✅ At the end of this phase → you have a **full AI Calling Assistant**.

## **Simple Flow Diagram**

`Customer speech     → Whisper (STT)     → GPT (Logic)     → TTS (Bot voice)     → Customer hears reply`

Call Path:

`Softphone (testing) → Asterisk → Bot    (later) SIP Trunk → Asterisk → Bot    (scaling) Twilio/Exotel → Bot`
